# ⚙️ MIMHO Solidity Contracts

This folder will contain the deployed Solidity contracts of the MIMHO Ecosystem.

All contracts are published **only after deployment**, ensuring:
- Source code matches on-chain bytecode
- No speculative or draft contracts
- Full auditability and verifiability

---

## ⏳ Current Status

- Contracts are **not yet deployed**
- Specifications are available in `contracts/specs/`
- Solidity sources will be added **at launch time**

---

## 🔒 Transparency Policy

MIMHO does **not** publish unfinished or placeholder Solidity logic.

When contracts appear here, they will be:
- Final
- Deployed
- Verified
- Linked to on-chain addresses

Until then, **specifications are the source of truth**.

## 📌 Note

If a contract does not exist in this folder,
it means it has **not been deployed yet**.
