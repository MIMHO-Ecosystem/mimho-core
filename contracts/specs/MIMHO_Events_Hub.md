## 👥 For Non-Technical Readers (Plain Explanation)

The MIMHO Events Hub is the public communication layer of the entire MIMHO ecosystem.

Every relevant action that happens inside the ecosystem is publicly recorded on-chain through this contract.

Instead of trusting announcements, posts, screenshots, or statements, MIMHO uses **on-chain events** as the single source of truth.

The Events Hub guarantees:

- Transparency
- Traceability
- Independent verification
- Permanent public history

The Events Hub:

- Does **not** hold user funds
- Does **not** execute business logic
- Does **not** change protocol rules

Its only role is to **announce what happened**.

If an action does not emit an event, **it did not happen**.

---

## 📡 What the Events Hub Records

The Events Hub receives standardized events from official ecosystem modules, including:

- Token actions (transfers, burns)
- Staking and unstaking
- Claims and distributions
- Governance votes
- Liquidity injections
- Marketplace actions
- DAO executions

These events power:

- Public dashboards (HUD)
- Audit trails
- Monitoring tools
- Community oversight

---

## 🤔 Why This Matters

In many crypto projects:

- Actions happen silently
- Data is fragmented
- Users must trust announcements

In MIMHO:

- Every important action is observable
- Events are immutable
- Transparency is enforced by code
- No trust is required

The blockchain itself tells the story.

## 👨‍💻 For Developers (Technical Summary)

The Events Hub follows a **single-responsibility design**.

Its purpose is to provide a unified and standardized event stream for:

- Dashboards
- Analytics
- Auditing
- Ecosystem observability

The Events Hub must **never interfere with execution flow**.

It is infrastructure, **not a dependency**.

---

## 🔐 Integration Rules

- All ecosystem modules **must emit events** to the Events Hub
- Emission **must follow a best-effort model**
- Failures in the Events Hub **must never revert transactions**
- Observability is optional — execution is not

---

## 🧭 Architecture (Registry-First)

- The Events Hub address is **always resolved via the MIMHO Registry**
- No contract is allowed to hardcode the Events Hub address
- This guarantees correct routing even after upgrades

---

## 🏛️ Governance Model

- Before DAO activation: controlled by the Founder
- After DAO activation: controlled exclusively by the DAO

No silent changes.  
No hidden emitters.  
No centralized control forever.
