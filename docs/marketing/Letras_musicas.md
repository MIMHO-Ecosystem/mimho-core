#Letras das Músicas - Ecossistema MIMHO

##Música 1: MIMHO - MARS IS MY HOUSE

Verse 1
Earth is the cradle, but we’ve outgrown the nest,
Looking at the red sky, put the vision to the test.
A vision leads the way, with a rocket and a dream,
And we provide the fuel for the multi-planet dream!
​Chorus
MIMHO! Mars Is My House!
From the desert sands to the Olympus mount.
MIMHO! Mars Is My House!
The future’s currency, no shadow of a doubt.
We’re not just visitors, we’re here to stay,
MIMHO is the light, leading the way!

##Música 2 : MIMHO TOKEN

Verse 1: The Foundation
One trillion tokens, a vision so clear,
Built on the BNB Chain, we conquer the fear.
The LP is burned, the keys thrown away,
A clean, pure contract that’s here to stay.
No hidden backdoors, no manual change,
The power of code is within our range!
​Chorus: The Core
MIMHO! The Memecoin of the Future!
Locked in the vault, 90% forever.
MIMHO! Transparent and pure,
A decentralized dream, we make it endure.
Stake it, Burn it, watch the DAO grow,
The future is MIMHO, now you know!
​Verse 2: The Ecosystem
From the Locker to Staking, the system is tied,
With an army of soldiers, we’ve got nowhere to hide.
Immutable, stable, and ready to rise,
Look at the charts, look at the skies!
MIMHO.
The Code is Law.

##Música 3 - MIMHO Registry

Verse 1: The First Step
Before the token, before the flame,
We built a home, we gave it a name.
The Registry stands as the first on the line,
Where every contract begins to shine.
No hidden paths, no manual doubt,
We mapped the future, we mapped it out!
​Chorus: The Source of Truth
MIMHO Registry! The heart of the core,
Connecting the system, opening the door.
MIMHO Registry! One source of truth,
From the early days to the days of youth.
Everything's linked, everything's clear,
The architecture of trust is here!
​Verse 2: Evolving Power
Version by version, we grow and we rise,
The DAO takes the wheel under digital skies.
From Staking to Burn, the Registry knows,
Wherever the path of the MIMHO goes.
Modular, solid, built to expand,
The strongest foundation in all of the land!
MIMHO.
The Origin. The Registry.

##Música 4 - MIMHO DAO

Verse 1: Democracy 2.0
The era of kings is over and gone,
A new light is breaking, a digital dawn.
From the President's seat to the Moderator's call,
The power is shared, it belongs to us all.
Quadratic voting, keeping it fair,
No whales in control, there’s no room for despair!
​Chorus: The DAO Rising
MIMHO DAO! The voice of the crowd,
Speak your vision, say it out loud.
MIMHO DAO! On-chain and true,
The future is decided by me and by you.
Governance locked, transparency set,
The strongest alliance you've ever met!
​Verse 2: The Cycle of Honor
One year of service, then pass the flame,
No double mandates, just honor the name.
Salaries earned from the growth that we make,
Pure performance in every single stake.
Audit the HUD, watch the votes rise,
A decentralized nation under Martian skies!
MIMHO DAO.
Your Vote. Your Power. Your House.

##Música 5 MIMHO Events Hub

Verse 1: Total Observability
Every buy, every burn, every stake,
Every move that the contracts make.
No hidden filters, no backend lies,
The truth is open to everyone's eyes.
From the chain to the HUD, in a blink of a light,
We bring the shadows into the bright!
Chorus: The Hub of Truth
MIMHO Events Hub! The pulse of the core,
Transparency like never before.
MIMHO Events Hub! Audit the flow,
Everything's public for everyone to know.
The action is locked, the record is set,
A standard of trust you'll never forget!
​Verse 2: Multi-Chain Vision
L1, L2, across the digital space,
The Hub is the witness, keeping the pace.
Zero Trust logic, the code is the guard,
For the fake and the bots, the entry is barred.
Standardized data, the future is clear,
The heart of the machine is operating here!
MIMHO Events Hub.
Observable. Immutable. Real.
