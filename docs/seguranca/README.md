## 🎯 Purpose

This section defines how security is **designed, enforced, and reviewed** across the MIMHO Ecosystem.

The goal is not to claim absolute safety, but to provide:
- Clear rules
- Verifiable architecture
- Auditable decision-making
- Transparent operational standards

Security in MIMHO is **code-driven**, not trust-driven.

---

## 🧱 Scope

This documentation covers:

- On-chain security architecture
- Contract-level safety principles
- Governance-related protections
- Internal audit methodology
- Transparency and traceability standards

This documentation does **not** include:
- Financial guarantees
- Price expectations
- Investment claims
- External audit reports (unless explicitly linked)

---

## 📄 Available Documents

### 🔐 Security Model
**File:** `SECURITY_MODEL.md`

Defines the formal security architecture of the MIMHO Ecosystem, including:
- Registry-first dependency resolution
- Events Hub observability model
- Permission boundaries
- DAO transition safeguards
- Fail-safe and non-blocking patterns

This is the **primary reference** for auditors and developers.

---

### 🧪 Internal Audit Process
**File:** `auditoria_interna.md`

Describes how MIMHO performs **internal security reviews**, including:
- Review methodology
- Tools and practices
- Threat modeling approach
- Continuous verification mindset

This document explains **how audits are done**, not audit results.

---

## 🔍 Transparency Principle

All security-relevant decisions in MIMHO follow these rules:

- No silent changes
- No hidden authority
- No undocumented behavior
- No off-chain exceptions

If something affects security, it must be:
- Documented
- Observable
- Verifiable on-chain

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

Security is an **ongoing process**, not a final state.

Modules, rules, and protections may evolve based on:
- New threat models
- Community governance decisions
- External audit feedback

All changes must remain public, documented, and auditable.
