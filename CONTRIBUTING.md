## 🧠 Core Principles

All contributions must follow these principles:

- **Transparency first**
- **Security over speed**
- **Deterministic behavior**

## 📝 Contribution Rules

### General Rules
- Be clear, objective, and technical

- Keep formatting GitHub-native

### Specs Rules
- Specs describe **behavior**, not implementation guesses
- No Solidity code inside Specs unless explicitly required
- State assumptions clearly
- Mark pre-deployment behavior explicitly

## 🔐 Security Contributions

Security-related contributions are **high priority**.

If you are reporting:
- A vulnerability
- A design risk
- A logic flaw

Do **not** open a public issue.

Instead:
- Follow the disclosure process in `SECURITY.md`
- Or contact the maintainers privately if instructed

---

## 🏛️ Governance & Authority

- Before DAO activation: final decisions rest with the Founder SAFE
- After DAO activation: governance decisions follow DAO rules
- No contribution can override governance processes

Merges may be delayed or declined to preserve system integrity.

---

## 📌 Commit Guidelines

- Use clear, descriptive commit messages
- Prefer prefixes:
  - `docs:` documentation changes
  - `spec:` specification changes
  - `security:` security-related changes
  - `chore:` maintenance

Example:

docs: clarify registry dependency resolution
