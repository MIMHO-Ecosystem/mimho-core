# Contributing — MIMHO Ecosystem

Thanks for your interest in contributing to the MIMHO Ecosystem.

This repository is primarily a **public registry and technical reference** for:
- Official documentation
- Contract specifications
- Address registries
- Post-deployment verified Solidity sources (when applicable)

---

## ✅ How to Contribute

### 1) Issues (recommended)
Use GitHub Issues to:
- report typos or documentation problems
- request clarifications to specs
- suggest improvements to repository structure
- report suspicious or incorrect addresses

Please include clear context and links to the exact file/section.

## 🔐 Solidity Policy (Important)

To avoid confusion and risk:
- We **do not accept** unsolicited Solidity implementations before official deployment.
- Solidity sources will be added only when:
  1. the contract is deployed on-chain
  2. the contract is verified on the explorer (e.g., BscScan)
  3. the address is published under `/addresses`

If you want to suggest a Solidity change:
- open an Issue referencing the spec file in `/contracts/specs`
- describe the change and rationale
- do not submit production Solidity code unless explicitly requested

---

## 📁 Repository Structure

- `/contracts/specs` — canonical technical specifications
- `/contracts/solidity` — placeholders and/or verified Solidity sources after deployment
- `/addresses` — official wallets and contract addresses (source of truth)
- `/docs` — documentation and public registry materials
- `/branding` — official brand assets
