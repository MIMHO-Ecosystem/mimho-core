# 🔐 MIMHO Trust & Token Rules

**MIMHO – The Meme Coin of the Future**

This document defines the **immutable rules**, **token mechanics**, and **trust guarantees** of the MIMHO Ecosystem.

All rules described here are **public**, **transparent**, and **verifiable on-chain**.  
This document contains **no financial promises** — only technical and operational behavior.

---

## 📌 What Is MIMHO?

MIMHO is a memecoin built with **real infrastructure**, **long-term vision**, and **strict rules defined from day one**.

The project was designed to:
- Grow sustainably  
- Protect holders  
- Eliminate hidden control  
- Transition safely to full DAO governance  

Every core rule is enforced by **smart contracts**, not people.

---

## 🪙 Token Supply

- **Total fixed supply:** 1,000,000,000,000 MIMHO (1 trillion)
- **Minting:** Not possible
- **Inflation:** None

The supply is **finite, immutable, and auditable**.

---

## 📊 Initial Distribution

- **Founder:** 5% (50B) — vested via smart contract  
- **Pre-sale:** 10% (100B)  
- **Initial Liquidity (LP):** 30% (300B)  
- **DAO Treasury:** 20% (200B)

- **Vesting:** 100% automated via smart contract
- **At purchase:** 20% unlocked

- **Manual intervention:** Not possible

---

## 🔥 Unsold Tokens

Any pre-sale tokens **not sold** are:

- **100% permanently burned**
- **Irreversibly removed from supply**
- **Never reused or redirected**

This mechanism benefits all holders.

---

## 🌊 Liquidity (LP)

- Liquidity pair: **MIMHO / WBNB**
- Platform: **PancakeSwap**
- **90% of LP:** Locked forever via MIMHO Locker
- **10% of LP:** Allocated to Founder wallet strictly for:
  - Project continuity
  - Technical operations
  - Future migrations

Liquidity **cannot** be removed for personal gain.

---

## 💸 Token Fees (Immutable)

- **Buy tax:** 1%
- **Sell tax:** 1.5%

From the sell tax, **0.5%** is automatically distributed to:
- Liquidity reinforcement
- Continuous burn
- Staking rewards

These fees are **immutable** and **cannot be changed**.

---

## 🔒 Vesting & Locks (Code-Enforced)

All vesting and lockups are enforced **exclusively by smart contracts**:

- Founder vesting
- Pre-sale vesting
- Ecosystem vesting
- DAO-related releases (only after DAO activation)

There is **zero human intervention** in unlocks.

---

## 🧠 Staking

- Activated approximately **10 days after launch**
- Rewards funded by protocol mechanisms
- Designed to reward **long-term holders**

---

## 🏛️ DAO Governance

The DAO is activated after the project reaches operational maturity.

Until then, governance remains limited to avoid premature risks.

### DAO Structure

- President
- Vice President
- Treasurer
- Two Mediators

### Compensation

- Paid **exclusively** from DAO treasury revenue
- Percentages are predefined and transparent
- No role can drain or harm the protocol
- Elections and impeachment are **enforced by code**

---

## 🧾 Ownership & Renouncement

- The token contract will be **renounced** once the DAO is fully active
- Ensures a safe transition from founder-led setup to community governance

---

## 🌐 Multichain Vision

MIMHO launches on **BNB Chain**, with architecture designed for future **multichain expansion**.

---

## 🎓 Education & Incentives

The ecosystem includes **Quiz Academy**, where holders:
- Learn about the protocol
- Earn MIMHO rewards through educational cycles

---

## ✅ Final Note

MIMHO was designed to **outlive hype cycles**.

- Clear rules
- Locked liquidity
- Immutable fees
- Transparent governance

Everything is defined **before launch**, enforced **by code**, and visible **on-chain**.
