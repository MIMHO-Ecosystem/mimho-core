## 📌 Official Statement

This repository is the **official, canonical, and authoritative source** for the technical and institutional documentation of the **MIMHO Ecosystem**.

All information contained here represents the **intended on-chain behavior, architecture, and governance design** of the MIMHO protocol.

Any other repository, website, document, or communication **must not be considered official** unless it explicitly references this repository.

---

## 🎯 Scope of This Repository

This repository exists to document and define:

- The **on-chain architecture** of the MIMHO Ecosystem
- The **behavior and rules** of each smart contract module
- The **governance and DAO transition model**
- The **security philosophy and operational constraints**
- The **token rules and trust boundaries**
- The **official addresses and mappings** (once deployed)

This repository does **not** exist to:
- Provide marketing promises
- Forecast prices or returns
- Promote speculation
- Replace on-chain verification

---

## 🧩 Source of Truth Principle

MIMHO follows a strict **Source of Truth** model:

- **Specs (`contracts/specs/`)** define *how modules are intended to behave*
- **Solidity contracts (`contracts/solidity/`)** enforce behavior on-chain
- **Events Hub** provides public, immutable observability
- **Addresses directory** defines official deployed addresses

If something is **not documented here or emitted on-chain**, it should not be trusted.

---

## 🔗 Relationship With External Documents

Some official documents are published as **immutable files on IPFS** (via Pinata), such as:

- Whitepaper
- Roadmap
- Manifesto

These documents:
- Are **referenced** by this repository
- Are **frozen and immutable**
- Do **not override** on-chain rules or specs

This repository remains the **living technical reference**, while IPFS documents serve as immutable public records.

---

## 🏗️ Pre-Deployment Status

At the current stage:

- Contracts are **finalized at design/spec level**
- Solidity code may be **pending deployment**
- Addresses are marked as **Awaiting Deploy**
- No contract should be considered live unless explicitly published here

Once deployed:
- Addresses will be added
- Historical data will never be removed
- Changes will be tracked transparently

---

## 🏛️ Governance Authority

Before DAO activation:
- The repository is maintained under **Founder authority**
- Changes follow strict internal review

After DAO activation:
- Governance authority transitions to the **MIMHO DAO**
- Documentation updates follow DAO-approved processes
- No unilateral control remains

This transition is **explicit, documented, and verifiable**.

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

- This repository describes **technical intentions and protocol behavior**
- Nothing here constitutes financial advice
- Participation in any blockchain system involves risk
- Users must verify on-chain data independently
