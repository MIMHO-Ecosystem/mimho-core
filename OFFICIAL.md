# OFFICIAL — MIMHO Ecosystem Verification

This file defines the **only official sources of truth** for the MIMHO Ecosystem.
Anything not explicitly referenced here must be considered **unofficial and potentially fraudulent**.

---

## ✅ Where to verify official wallets (SAFE addresses)

All official project wallets (Founder, DAO, Marketing, Reserves, Donations, Burn, Security, Labs, etc.) are published and maintained in:

- `addresses/README.md`
- `addresses/wallets.md`

If an address is not listed inside the `/addresses` folder, it is **not an official MIMHO wallet**.

---

## ✅ Where to verify official smart contracts

A smart contract is considered **official only after all steps below**:

1. The contract is deployed on-chain  
2. The contract is verified on the official explorer (e.g., BscScan)  
3. The final deployed address is published in:
   - `addresses/README.md` (main registry overview)
   - and/or a network registry file under `/addresses`

If a contract address is not published inside `/addresses`, it is **not an official MIMHO contract**.

---

## 🌐 Official channels

- **Official Website:** https://mimho.io  
- **Official Registry & Documentation:** this GitHub repository (MIMHO-Ecosystem / mimho-core)

Any other domain, mirror, or page is not official unless explicitly listed here.

---

## 🚨 Scam prevention rules

- The MIMHO team will never request funds via private messages
- There is no private or hidden presale
- There are no “manual payments” or direct wallet transfers outside official contracts
- Never trust screenshots or forwarded messages as proof of legitimacy

Any unsolicited contact claiming to represent MIMHO should be treated as a scam.

---

## Final verification rule

**If it is not published in `/addresses` and not referenced by this repository, it is not official.**
